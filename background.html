          <p> Rugby, also known as Rugby Union, is a contact team sport which originated in England. Although it seems very similar to football there are many aspect that make it completely different. For one, instead of passing the ball forward like in football, it is passed backwards. Two there no padding/protection unlike football which have shoulder pads. Rugby also has two forms in which it can be played. It can either be played with two teams of 7 (so 14 in total) or two teams of 15 ( so total would be 30). The game is broken down into two 40 mins halves with a 10 min rest period. Other than that it is played continuously Rugby is played with an oval ball and the objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. When you score a point it is known as a try. It is very popular in countries such as South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand and since itâ€™s the most popular there that is where the best players are.</p>
